Bitbolt Network Bitcoin Adaptor

Adaptor Node Cluster:  
The information node cluster is responsible for message exchange between the BitBolt Network and the Bitcoin Network,  
such as sending BTC from the BitBolt Network to addresses on the Bitcoin Network,  
and obtaining current Bitcoin blockchain data from Bitcoin full nodes.  
The information node cluster achieves consensus on the data fetched from the Bitcoin Network  
and transfers the data to the consensus nodes in the BitBolt Network for their use.
